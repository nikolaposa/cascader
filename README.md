Cascader enables the creation of objects from array definitions that represent constructor parameters. Given the class name and creation options array, it will try to create a target object, also creating nested objects that may exist. Convenient as a factory for generic kind of objects.

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command to install the latest version of a package and add it to your project's `composer.json`:

```bash
composer require nikolaposa/cascader
```

## Usage

```php
$cascader = new Cascader();

$object = $cascader->create(RootObject::class, [
    'name' => 'foo',
    'sub_object' => [
        'category' => 'bar',
        'count' => 10,
    ],
    'is_active' => true,
]);
```
